# Run analyzing tool.
Analyzing run from heart rate, pace and cadence.
Uses .tcx file from (e.g. garmin, coros etc).

## Todo:
1. Compare two runs as fitness change metrics.
2. Evaluate easy, threshold pace from overall data (finding it relatively correctly from least amount of data will be the goal).
3. Training load/effect.
