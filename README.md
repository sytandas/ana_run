# Run analyzing tool.
Analyzing run from heart rate, pace and cadence for now simplicity.
Currently used .tcx file from (garmin/coros) wearables to analyze data to improve running.

## Todo:
1. Evaluate easy, threshold pace from overall data (found out the least amount of data needed to do relatively correctly).
2. Mileage load.
3. Training improvement overtime.
