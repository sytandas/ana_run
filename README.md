# Run analyzing tool.
Analyzing run from heart rate, pace and cadence.
Uses .tcx file from (e.g. garmin, coros etc).

## Todo:
1. Compare two runs as fitness change metrics.
2. Evaluate easy, threshold pace from overall data (found out the least amount of data needed to do relatively correctly).
3. Training load and effect.
